IDS - Intrusion Detection System
Author: Tiago Natel de Moura aka i4k

This project is a PoC of various ideas that I've been thinking about IDS.
BASH isn't the best language for this task, but is the most fast to interact
with the unix operating system. If this project succeed, I will rewrite the
core daemon in C.

If you want more information about that, please contact me!
